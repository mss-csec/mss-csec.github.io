# Automatically resolve conflicts of a deterministic nature
# Trying to rebase the build branch on the deploy branch tends to result in
# conflicts, but thankfully, we know that:
#   (1) the conflicts are between master:HEAD and $commit
#   (2) the changes we want are from $commit
# Thus, for each file with conflicts, we checkout the changes from $commit
# (hence the --theirs flag) and add it to the index.
# Finally, we continue the rebase, which should succeed and leave us with
# a successfully rebased build branch.
