###### Markville's *Computer Science Education Club* is a group of students who share a deep interest in computer science and competitive programming.
###### We participate in competitions and hold sessions every week where we teach lessons on how to program.

## Activities

Every year, CSEC participates in two major programming competitions:
the [CCC](http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html) and
the [ECOO](http://ecoocs.org/).
The Beginners' subclub prepares for the Junior level of the CCC, and the Advanced subclub prepares for the Senior level of the CCC.
The top eight students of the Senior CCC, top four students of the Junior CCC, and top four female students are then chosen to represent MSS in the ECOO.
