Hello everyone!

Our first meeting is scheduled to be this **Friday, October 6** after school in **room 206**, which is next to room 205, which is across the hallway between 208 and 204 in the business/tech hall.

We'll be explaining more about the club and about Computer Science, we'll iron out signup discrepancies, and if logistics allow the Coding subclubs will be splitting up to work on getting set up for the year.

We strongly suggest you attend this meeting, though if you are unable to, we will send out a recap email with any important information attached.

See you Friday!

CSEC Exec Team
