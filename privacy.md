## Our use of cookies and tracking

#### Cookies

MSS CSEC uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to remember your preferences, such as your preferred sitewide theme.

A cookie is a small piece of text that our website stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser makes available to us when you browse this site. The individual cookies that the CSEC website sets do not uniquely identify you in any way. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device's ability to accept cookies, you will experience reduced functionality of the website.

#### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we don’t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use the CSEC website. This helps us evaluate our users' use of the website; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance.

Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of the CSEC website. We do not link this information to any of your personal information, nor do we have the capability to.

MSS CSEC will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users individually; collect any User Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate your IP address with your identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a [browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking] (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can’t always control what cookies this third party content sets.

#### GitHub Pages

Our webhost, GitHub Pages, may collect basic information about your requests. This information includes your browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of your request. 

For more information about what GitHub collects, please read the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/).

## Changes to our Privacy Notice

Although most changes are likely to be minor, MSS CSEC may change our Privacy Notice from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Notice through this website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page. For changes to this Privacy Notice that do not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check this page frequently.
