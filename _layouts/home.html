<h1>MSS CSEC is Slowly Engineering a Club website</h1>

<p>Hello, person! We see you discovered our top-secret website-in-construction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have no content to offer but the fact that we'll probably be back in September with a swanking new website to suit all of your MSS CSEC needs. Until then, have a great summer!</p>


<code>It is currently <span id="time">time to enable JavaScript, you dimwit</span>. <span id="message"></span></code>

<script>
document.getElementById('time').textContent = (new Date()).toLocaleString();

var h = (new Date()).getHours(), msg = "";

if (23 <= h || h <= 1) msg = "Go to sleep, you moron."
if (2 <= h && h <= 7) msg = "I'm telling your parents you're still awake."
if (8 <= h && h <= 10) msg = "Rise and shine, walnut-head."
if (11 <= h && h <= 22) msg = "I hope you enjoy trying to be productive and utterly failing at it."

document.getElementById('message').textContent = msg
</script>
